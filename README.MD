## How Brizy works
Builder seamlessly integrates with your existing site or app, enabling you to visually create and modify code using your current components or our intuitive drag-and-drop editor.
You can then export the code or directly publish updates.

## Documentation

The official Brizy documentation can be found on our [documentation website](https://builder-docs.brizy.io/docs/developer-docs/the-docs-website)

The release notes can be found [here](https://github.com/EasyBrizy/Brizy/releases).

## Quick Start
Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install @brizy/builder
```

## Available Components

### 1. Preview Component
The `Preview` component allows you to render content in preview mode without editor modules such as the toolbar or sidebar.

#### Example Usage
```tsx
import type { EditorPage, EditorProject } from "@brizy/builder/preview";
import { Preview } from "@brizy/builder/preview";

// @import css
import "@brizy/builder/preview/styles.css";

const pageData: EditorPage = {}
const projectData: EditorProject = {};

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Preview Mode</h1>
      <Preview pageData={pageData} projectData={projectData} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### 2. Editor Mode with Toolbar and Sidebar
The `Editor` component provides a fully interactive editor mode, equipped with both a toolbar and sidebar to enhance editing functionality.
This component is essential for creating and managing content within a structured, user-friendly interface.

#### Example Usage
```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Editor as BrizyEditor } from "@brizy/builder/editor";
import type { EditorConfig, EditorPage, EditorProject } from "@brizy/builder";

// @import css
import "@brizy/builder/editor/styles.css";

// @import icons
import brizyIcons from "@brizy/builder/editor/icons/icons.svg";

const config: EditorConfig = {
  urls: {
    editorIcons: brizyIcons
  }
};

const pageData: EditorPage = {}
const projectData: EditorProject = {};

const Editor: React.FC = () => {
  return <BrizyEditor pageData={pageData} projectData={projectData} config={config} />;
};

export default Editor;
```

> **Note:** The `Config` object contains settings for the editor. You can find more details about `Config` in the [Brizy Builder Documentation](https://builder-docs.brizy.io/docs/getting-started/what-is-brizy/).
