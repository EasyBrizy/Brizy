## Usage
Below is an example of how to integrate the editor into your page using the CDN, showing the necessary HTML structure.

```html
<!-- Builder Container -->
<div id="editor" style="height: 85vh; width: 100vw"></div>

<!-- Update button -->
<button id="update">Update</button>

<!-- Always use the latest version. Check the version details in GitHub releases. -->
<script src="https://cdn.brizylocal.com/pages/3.1.15/index.js"></script>

<script>
  // Config Example: https://github.com/EasyBrizy/Brizy-Local/blob/story/packages/demo/public/index.html
  const config = {...};
  
  const editor = document.querySelector("#editor");
  const update = document.querySelector("#update");
  const Builder = window.Builder;
  let builderAPI;
  // This demo token will limit the output to a pre determined HTML and let you test the Editor before deciding on a commercial license.
  // To unlock all functionality and reseller the editor to your clients, you'll need an unique token generated by us.
  // Contact us: https://www.brizy.io/brizylocal#lets-talk
  const token = "demo";
  
  Builder.init(token, config, (api) => {
    builderAPI = api;
  });
  update.addEventListener("click", () => {
    builderAPI.save();
  });
</script>
```

## API Interface

The `API` interface exposes methods for saving and compiling actions. Below are the details of the methods available:

### Methods

#### `save(cb?: OnSave) => void`

The `save` method triggers the save functionality within the Builder. During this process, the Builder checks the
initial data and compares it with any changes. If modifications are detected, the Builder compiles only the changed
data, which could include `ProjectData` or `PageData`. Optionally, you can pass a callback function to handle custom
behavior after the save operation completes.

**Parameters:**

- `cb?` (optional): A callback function of type `OnSave` to execute after the save operation.

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
builderAPI.save(() => {
  console.log("Save operation completed!");
});
```

#### `compile(cb?: OnCompile) => void`

The `compile` method initiates a forced compile process within the Builder. Unlike the `save` method, the `compile`
method bypasses checks for changes and compiles all data, including both `ProjectData` and `PageData`. Optionally, you
can pass a callback function to handle custom behavior after the compile operation finishes.

**Parameters:**

- `cb?` (optional): A callback function of type `OnCompile` to execute after the compile operation.

**Example Usage:**

```typescript
builderAPI.compile(() => {
  console.log("Compile operation completed!");
});
```

### Initialization and Usage

To use the `API` methods, the Builder must first be initialized with a token, configuration, and a callback to set the
API instance.

#### Initialization

```typescript
Builder.init(token, config, (api) => {
  builderAPI = api;
});
```

- **`token`**: A string representing the authentication token.
- **`config`**: Configuration options for the Builder.
- **`api`**: The callback parameter, which is an instance of the `API` interface.

### Event Listener Example

Once initialized, you can use the `builderAPI` instance to invoke methods. For instance, attaching a save operation to a
button click event:

```typescript
update.addEventListener("click", () => {
  builderAPI.save();
});
```

In this example, clicking the `update` button triggers the `save` method.
